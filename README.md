# Documentation
### Overview
This repository holds documentation related to the team. The flavour of this
documentation is primarily educational, containing papers, datasheets, style
guidlines and team member written documentation.
### Uploading Documentation
We make a distinction between
internal and external documentation.
- internal documentation is generated by team members or organisations and cannot
be easily found on the internet.
- external documentation such as papers and datasheets which can be easily found
on the internet.

For internal documentation, you can upload the raw file to the files
directory in the associated documentation folder. Please name it sensibly and
don't use spaces or special characters in the title.  For external documentation
please hyperlink to the document wherever possible.

### Help
In the event that links to documentation are broke:
- If the link is to internal documentation in a files directory, it could be
broken because the file was removed, renamed, or the repository path has been
altered. If the document is still contained in the files directory, fix the link
and push the change. If the document has been removed, remove the link.
- If the link is to external documentation, check the [internet archive](https://archive.org/).
If the documentation is on the archive, link to the archive and push the change.
Otherwise remove the link.
