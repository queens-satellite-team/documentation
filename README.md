# Documentation
### Overview
This repository holds documentation related to the team. Other repositories will
contain documentation that is specific to their projects and development,
whereas the flavour of this documentation is primarily educational.
### Uploading Documentation
The documentation should be written by team members. We have had problems in the
past with raw PDF's being uploaded in bulk and no one using them. If you are 
posting a paper or datasheet, please hyperlink to it using the Github markdown
and give a short description of why it is useful.
