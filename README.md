# Documentation
### Overview
This repository holds documentation related to the team. The flavour of this
documentation is primarily educational, containing papers, datasheets, style
guidlines and team member written documentation. 
### Uploading Documentation
The documentation should be written by team members. We have had problems in the
past with raw PDF's being uploaded in bulk and no one using them. Some of these
files can be large (>10 MB) and clog the repo. If you are posting a paper or
datasheet and it is publically available, please hyperlink it in the associated
README using the Github markdown and give a short description of why it is useful.
