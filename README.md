# Documentation
### Overview
This repository holds documentation related to the team. The flavour of this
documentation is primarily educational, containing papers, datasheets, style
guidlines and team member written documentation. 
### Uploading Documentation
The documentation should be written by team members. We have had problems in the
past with raw PDF's being uploaded in bulk and no one using them. If you are 
posting a paper or datasheet, please hyperlink to it using the Github markdown
and give a short description of why it is useful.
