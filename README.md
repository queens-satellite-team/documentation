# Getting Started
We are a university design team that represents [Queen's Unversity](https://www.queensu.ca/)
in the [Canadian Satellite Design Team](https://www.csdcms.ca/) (CSDC). Any
student (undergraduate and graduate) of Queen's or RMC is welcome to join the
team.

Getting started on a design team can be intimidating. Some common fears are:
  * You are worried about making a mistake.
  * You feel you lack the necessary or relevant technical knowledge.
  * You are worried about over commiting and becoming overwhelmed during the
     semester.

We understand, we had the same fears and aprehensions when we first got involved.
Let's talk about each one.
  * We like mistakes. We have made some pretty big ones ourselves, including
    frying a $6000 transceiver board.
  * We'd like to help you learn. No previous space related or serious technical
    knowledge is required.
  * By using Github, all of our work is nicely synchronised and it is easy to
    offload tasks. If you are working on something and have to stop, push your
    most recent work and notify the relevant team lead you need to offload the
    task.

Alot of these fears come from thinking that our design team is going to be like
working for a company. It isn't. It is more like an
[open source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_source) project. Our team has
a clear purpose:
  > Launch a satellite designed, fabricated and validated by undergraduate/graduate students into space.

If this excites you and you are willing to learn, you are a great fit for the
team.  When determinng what you want to work on, the first choice is:
- Do I want to program?
- Do I want to design circuit boards?
- Do I want to do CAD?

After you decide that you can take a look through the [repositories](https://github.com/queens-satellite-team)
and associated issues ([here](https://github.com/queens-satellite-team/moc-sat/issues) are the MocSat issues).
Once you have found a project or issue that interests you:
  - If you know how to fix the issue, do so and make a pull request to be
    reviewed by the team lead.
  - Post in the [new members](https://github.com/orgs/queens-satellite-team/teams/new-members)
    team discussion with what your technical interest is (code, PCB design, CAD)
    and sub-system. The team lead will then be able to give you more information.

### The Competition
In order to compete in the CSDC we are building a [3 Unit Cube-Satellite](https://www.asc-csa.gc.ca/eng/satellites/cubesat/what-is-a-cubesat.asp).
We were started in 2016 and have competed once in the CSDC 2016-2018 competition
season. The CSDC is a two-year competition, so we would have competed again in
the 2020 but the competition was postponed due to Covid-19, likely until 2021 or
2022.

The competition is held at the Canadian Space Agency. The satellite undergoes
vibration testing to assess flight readiness. It is then inspected by the judges
and team members are asked to demonstrate the functionality of the required
subsystems. The satellite that is deemed to be the most flight-ready is awarded
1st place. Though it is the satellite that is being evaluated, the team plays an
important role in the decision. The judges understand that the resources available
to each team (money and faculty support) are not evenly distributed and that
some teams have to make due with less. For example, a team who could not afford
to purchase flight ready solar panels is not penalized against a team who could.
They are interested in the effectiviness of the team and the ability to
demonstrate exceptional engineering ability.

The CSDC only ranks the top three teams and we didn't place in the top three
in our 2016-2018. Anecdotally, out of about 12 teams we were in the middle of the
pack. The team at the time was much stronger in mechanical engineering than
electrical or computer, so we had a good structure but some of our electrical
sub systems were not working. It is not uncommon for teams to bring unfinished
or unintegrated satellites to the competition. In fact, having a fully integrated
satellite will likely place you in or near the top three.

### Roles on the Team
The satellite is composed of sub-systems. The sub-systems are:
  - Attitude Determination and Control System (ADCS)
  - Communications System (Comms)
  - Electrical Power System (EPS)
  - On-Board Computer (OBC)

Sub-systems are managed by a sub-system team lead. Each sub-system requires
electrical, computer and mechanical engineering.

### FAQ
  * "I am in first year, I will join next year when I have learned more."
    - As a first year, you are really valuable for the team because you could
      spend a lot of years on the team. This is why we started space school.

  * "I am in fourth year, the exec has already been hired and there is no reason
    to join a design team now."
    - Being in your final year means you probably have the most accumulated
      knowledge and you could make a big difference on the team. Since all our
      work is open source, you can show employers how much you have contributed
      and they can see your work.
